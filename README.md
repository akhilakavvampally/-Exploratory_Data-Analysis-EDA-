## 📊 EDA Includes:
1. Summary statistics (mean, median, std, etc.)
2. Handling missing values
3. Histograms and boxplots for numeric features
4. Correlation matrix and pairplot
5. Skewness detection
6. Plotly interactive visualizations
7. Feature-level inferences

## 📈 Key Insights:
- 🚶‍♂️ Passengers in higher classes (1st) had better survival chances.
- 📉 Age and Fare distributions are skewed.
- 💰 Fare is positively correlated with Pclass.
- ⚠️ Outliers are present in Age across all classes.
