# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand the structure, summary statistics, visual patterns, and feature-level insights.

## ðŸ§° Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly

## ðŸ“Š EDA Includes:
1. Summary statistics (mean, median, std, etc.)
2. Handling missing values
3. Histograms and boxplots for numeric features
4. Correlation matrix and pairplot
5. Skewness detection
6. Plotly interactive visualizations
7. Feature-level inferences

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights:
- Higher-class passengers had better survival chances.
- Age and Fare distributions are skewed.
- Fare is positively correlated with Pclass.
- Outliers are present in Age across all classes.
